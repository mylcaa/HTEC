## Single linked list using smart pointers
This exercise is meant as a reminder of basic C++ concepts. Through it will be revisited the topic of templates and the use of smart pointers.
### Tasks: 
* write the skeleton of the templated class `LinkedList` - including it's constructor
* limit the allowed template types to `int` and `float`
* implement the specified member functions `insert()` `push_back()` and `clear()`
* write a simple code to test the functionality of the class
